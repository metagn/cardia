todo modules:
- ring integers mod N
- generating function partial generators for some series
- make generic groups/rings work, bigints etc
- legendre (jacobi) symbol etc
- formal logic & formal language representation
- maybe graph stuff
- free groups & presentations?
- definitely permutation groups
- primes probably
  - off-memory cache? primes up to 8 billion are 1 GB
- quadratic integers, pythagorean triples etc
- maybe linear systems of modular equations

in general don't want too many approximations
